# Code of Conduct
To keep this project clean, maintainable, and enjoyable to work on, please follow these simple guidelines:

1. Avoid goto whenever possible. Use structured control flow instead.
2. Keep functions small and focused. One task per function.
3. Comment non-obvious code. Help others (and your future self) understand it.
4. Test the code and check for memory leaks before any commit. Stability and correctness matter.
